# Decision Tree Classifier for Cancer Diagnosis

## Description
This C++ program implements a decision tree classifier to classify cancer as either benign or malignant based on cell features. It reads data from a CSV file, applies the decision tree logic, and outputs the classified results. The classifier uses specific criteria like Uniformity of Cell Size, Clump Thickness, Bare Nuclei, and others to make a decision.

## Installation
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. No additional libraries are required.

## Usage
Compile the program using your C++ compiler:
Input data should be in a CSV file named 'unformatted_data_v1.0.0.csv'. The output will be saved in 'results.csv'.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the classifier or extend its functionality are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
